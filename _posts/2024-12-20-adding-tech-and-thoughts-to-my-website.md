I've been meaning to add a space to my website where I can share projects I'm working on and write about technology, mental health, and the intersection of the two.

## Why a Blog?

Over the years, I've found that writing helps me process ideas and share knowledge with others. Whether it's documenting a technical solution or reflecting on lessons learned, having a place to write feels important.

## What You'll Find Here

This section will include:

- **Recent Projects**: A curated list of things I've been working on, from open source contributions to personal projects
- **Blog Posts**: Thoughts on technology, mental health, neurodiversity, and building things that matter

## The Technical Details

This site is built with Jekyll and Tailwind CSS. The blog uses Jekyll's built-in posts system, with Simple Icons providing technology logos for tags. It's a simple setup that lets me focus on writing rather than infrastructure.

If you're interested in how it's put together, the source is available on GitHub.
