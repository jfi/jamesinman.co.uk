  <h1 class="text-5xl font-display font-normal mb-8">Hi, I’m James Inman.</h1>
  <p class="text-xl text-secondaryText max-w-2xl mx-auto font-body mb-4">
  I work at the intersection of <strong>technology, mental health, and psychology</strong> — helping organisations and individuals make a difference through their work, and in their own lives.
  </p>

  <p class="text-md text-secondaryText max-w-2xl mx-auto font-body mb-4">With over 15 years in software and leadership, I’ve founded companies from scratch, seen some acquired, and held Board-level roles running technology and product teams in international private equity‑backed businesses. I'm also late-diagnosed with Autism and ADHD, and have studied psychology and mental health intensively.
  </p>

  <p class="text-md text-secondaryText max-w-2xl mx-auto font-body mb-4">
    Not every venture went to plan, and not every choice I made was the right one. Along the way I’ve learned a great deal about resilience, perspective, and how to adapt. That experience now drives my work — helping purpose‑driven organisations solve complex problems, and supporting people as they navigate their own challenges.
  </p>
