    I offer 1:1 mentoring and coaching for people navigating complex transitions — whether that’s in your career, your mental health, or understanding yourself better. I work with a small number of clients at a time, and sessions are flexible, confidential, and grounded in lived experience.
  </p>

  <p class="text-md text-secondaryText mx-auto font-body mb-8">
    Here are some of the areas I focus on. As well as these, I'm a confident interview coach – I’ve interviewed over 200 people in my career and offer <strong>gentle interview coaching</strong> if you’re preparing for new roles or just want to explore what makes you tick.

          <strong>Support for neurodivergent people — from someone who’s walked a similar path</strong><br><br>
          You might be newly diagnosed or just starting to make sense of your neurodivergence. You might be trying to unpick how burnout, masking, or past roles have affected you.<br><br>Or you might simply want someone who can listen, get it, and help you find clarity — without pressure to mask, perform or explain yourself.<br><br>
          I bring a neuroaffirming approach informed by deep psychological study and lived experience of late diagnosis. My Psychology MSc dissertation was focused on interpersonal touch, and I understand the history of growing up with, and without, knowing you're neurodivergent.

          <strong>Helping people in tech navigate burnout, big decisions, or complex environments</strong><br><br>
          I’ve spent 15+ years working across tech — as a founder, developer, CTO and CPO. I know what it’s like to work in high-stakes environments, manage the weight of leadership, or feel stuck in a career that once excited you. I also know the pull of flow state — and how it can lead to 12-hour (and longer) days chasing completion, even when it’s costing you your health or relationships.<br><br>
          I offer space to step back, get perspective, and figure out what’s next — whether you’re changing role, returning to an old one, or working out whether the culture around you is still sustainable.

    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold font-body mb-2">Pricing & Booking</h2>
    <p class="text-md text-secondaryText font-body mb-4">
      Sessions last one hour (60 minutes) via Zoom. I’ll usually ask for cameras on at the start just to say hello — but you’re free to turn them off if that feels more comfortable.<br><br>We can also split sessions into two  blocks with a break if an hour feels too long to focus for.<br><br>
      Sessions are available <strong>weekly</strong> or <strong>fortnightly</strong> at flexible times to suit you, including evenings and weekends.
      Most people benefit from a block of 6 sessions to explore a specific issue. For deeper transitions or long-term changes, 10–12 sessions often means you can see meaningful progress and reflection.<br><br>
      I offer a discounted price for booking a block of 6 sessions at once, but can also setup payment plans so you can spread the cost of sessions.

    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold font-body mb-4">FAQs</h2>
    <div class="space-y-6">
      <div>
        <h3 class="font-semibold font-body">Do I need a diagnosis to work with you?</h3>
        <p class="text-md text-secondaryText font-body">No. I work with clients regardless of whether you're neurodivergent or not — and self-identified, questioning, or formally diagnosed. You don’t need a label to be supported.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="font-semibold font-body">How do I pay for sessions?</h3>
        <p class="text-md text-secondaryText font-body">Payment is through the buttons above using a credit or debit card before your session(s) take place. You can also set up a direct debit if that's easier for you. I accept <strong>Access to Work</strong> funding, and am happy to invoice employers.<br><br>If you're genuinely struggling with the price of sessions (for example, you're unemployed and not in receipt of benefits) but would like to access my services, I can offer some discretionary discounts: <a href="mailto:james@jamesinman.co.uk" class="font-bold text-accentPink hover:text-accentPinkHover underline">email me</a> for more information.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="font-semibold font-body">Do I have to keep my camera on?</h3>
        <p class="text-md text-secondaryText font-body">No. You’re welcome to turn your camera off after we say hello — unless we’re doing something like interview coaching where face-to-face might help.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="font-semibold font-body">Is this coaching or therapy?</h3>
        <p class="text-md text-secondaryText font-body">This is mentoring and coaching, not therapy. Our focus will be future-facing, practical, and supportive. If you’re unsure what’s right for you, we can explore that in an intro call.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="font-semibold font-body">Can you help with my mental health?</h3>
        <p class="text-md text-secondaryText font-body">I'm not a trained mental health professional. If you're struggling with your mental health, you should contact your GP or another mental health professional – if you're in crisis, call 999 or 111 option 2. <a class="underline text-accentPink hover:text-accentPinkHover font-bold" href="https://www.mind.org.uk/need-urgent-help/using-this-tool/">Mind</a> have some resources which may be able to help you.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="font-semibold font-body">Who do you work with?</h3>
        <p class="text-md text-secondaryText font-body">I work with adults of all backgrounds, genders, and identities. My practice is inclusive and affirming — and I’ll do my best to meet your access needs wherever possible.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="font-semibold font-body">What’s your approach like?</h3>
        <p class="text-md text-secondaryText font-body">Warm, structured, and collaborative. I won’t overwhelm you with theory, but I may offer frameworks from my background in psychology, leadership, and mental health. You’ll be met with respect, care, and no pressure to be anything other than yourself.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="font-semibold font-body">I've got more questions</h3>
        <p class="text-md text-secondaryText font-body">That's completely understandable - embarking on a new mentoring/coaching programme, especially for the first time, can be scary!
